#AES project 

This elementary encryption/decryption program is used for encryption/ decryption of files
using AES coding. Through command line,user specifies what action he wants,
and accordingly after that passes parameters for filepaths.
Program is also used to generate a digest string using SHA-256 algorithm.
Every file has a unique digest ,so program checks if a generated digest and 
string user typed in are the same.
